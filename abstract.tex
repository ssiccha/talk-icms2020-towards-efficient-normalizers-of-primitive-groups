Title:
Normalizers of primitive groups with non-regular socle in polynomial time

Abstract:
The \emph{normalizer problem} has as input generating sets $X$ and
$Y$ for subgroups $G$ and $H$ of the symmetric group $S_n$, and asks
one to return generators for $N_H(G)$.

Polynomial time solutions are known for many permutation group
problems. However, polynomial time algorithms for, for example, computing
intersections of permutation groups or solving the normalizer problem have so
far proven elusive.

In my PhD Thesis For a primitive group with non-regular socle $G$ we present an
algorithm to compute the normalizer $N_{S_n}(G)$ both practically
efficiently and in polynomial time. For primitive groups $G$ of the
above type, this yields a reduction of the normalizer problem to the
Luks class.
