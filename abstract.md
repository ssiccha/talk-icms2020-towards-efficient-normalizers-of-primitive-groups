Title:
Normalizers of simple diagonal groups in polynomial time

Abstract:
The *normalizer problem* has as input generating sets X and Y for subgroups G and H of the symmetric group S_n, and asks one to return generators for the normalizer of H in G.

In my PhD thesis I developed algorithms for the situation where G is the symmetric group S_n and H is primitive with non-regular socle. These algorithms are both practically efficient and run in polynomial time. In this talk I will focus on primitive groups of simple diagonal (SD) type. I will also present the main tool I use to structure both theory and algorithms: permutation morphisms, a generalization of permutation isomorphisms.
